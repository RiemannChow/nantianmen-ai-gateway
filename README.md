<br>

# 💌 Why Did We Build nantianmen-ai-gateway?
Before building nantianmen-ai-gateway, we spent seven years developing an API development and automated testing platform with over 1 million developer users, 500+ enterprise customers, and multi-million-dollar investment from Sequoia Capital.

As AI and Agents evolved, we noticed many enterprises wanted to integrate AI into both internal and third-party APIs, enabling AI agents to perform more complex tasks beyond being just knowledge-based Q&A bots. Hence, we built nantianmen-ai-gateway—your all-in-one AI gateway and API developer portal to accelerate your AI API development and quickly build your product or AI agent!

<br>

# ✨ Quick Start
nantianmen-ai-gateway is designed to solve the following problems:
- Seamlessly connect to various AI models and package these AI capabilities into APIs for easy calling, significantly reducing the barrier to using AI models.
- Manage complex AI & API call relationships.
- Manage API creation, monitoring, and security.
- Fault detection and troubleshooting: Simplifying system issue identification and resolution.
- Quantify data asset value: Enhance the visibility and valuation of data assets.

<br>

😍 Deploying nantianmen-ai-gateway is incredibly simple. With just one command line, you can deploy your AI gateway and API developer portal in under 5 minutes.

```
curl -sSO  https://download.nantianmen-ai-gateway.com/install/quick-start.sh ;  bash quick-start.sh

# 🏗 Architecture Notes

nantianmen-ai-gateway follows a layered design:

![connection architecture](readme/img/architecture.svg)

```
HTTP (gin + eosc autowire)
  └─ controller   # API layer: auth, parameter validation, response wrapping
      └─ module   # business orchestration: transactions, cross-service coordination
          └─ service  # domain logic (may only access this module's store)
              └─ stores  # data access (MySQL/Redis, uniformly wrapped)
```

Key runtime facts worth knowing before diving in:

- **Dependency injection**: based on `eolinker/go-common`'s `autowire`; struct fields are
  injected via the `autowired:""` tag — no constructor parameter passing.
- **Data-plane proxy**: request forwarding and policy execution (rate limiting `limiting`,
  circuit breaking `fuse`, canary `grey`, AI formatting `ai_formatter`, etc.) are driven by
  the apinto gateway on the data plane; the control plane (this repo) publishes policies/routes
  to the data plane.
- **LLM streaming**: SSE streaming responses from remote models are handled by the data-plane
  proxy; local (ollama) model pull progress is streamed via the executor pipeline in
  `ai-provider/local`.
- **Rate limiting**: implemented through the "policy → limiting driver → apinto limiting
  plugin" chain; it is an enterprise (`advanced_policy`) capability.
- **Sensitive config encryption**: `common/crypto` provides transparent AES-256-GCM encryption;
  the master key is `config.yml`'s `secret.encryption_key`.
- **Observability**: a dedicated admin port (default `127.0.0.1:9464`) exposes
  `/metrics` (Prometheus: request count/latency/inflight + Go runtime metrics),
  `/debug/pprof/*`, and `/healthz`; the address is configured via `config.yml`'s `metrics.addr`,
  set to `off` to disable.

# 🚩 Roadmap
We’ve set exciting goals for nantianmen-ai-gateway: enabling everyone to quickly create their own products and AI agents using AI and APIs!

To achieve this goal, we plan to add new features to nantianmen-ai-gateway, including:
1. Integrating with API marketplaces such as Postman, RapidAPI, APISpace, APILayer, etc. You can directly use APIs from various API marketplaces through nantianmen-ai-gateway and make them smarter using AI.
2. Integrating AI Agents such as Langchain, AgentGPT, Auto-GPT, Dify, and more, allowing AI Agents to access your internal or third-party APIs through nantianmen-ai-gateway to complete more complex tasks.
3. Intelligent API orchestration: nantianmen-ai-gateway will provide a unified API entry point and automatically orchestrate multiple APIs to fulfill your requests based on the API content.
